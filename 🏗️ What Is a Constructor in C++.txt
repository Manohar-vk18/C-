üèóÔ∏è What Is a Constructor in C++?
A constructor is a member function that runs automatically when an object is instantiated.

It sets initial values for data members or allocates resources.

It has the same name as the class and no return type, not even void.

üéØ Why Do We Use Constructors?
Automatic Initialization: Ensures objects start with valid or default values.

Code Simplification: Reduces the need for separate initialization logic.

Encapsulation: Keeps initialization logic inside the class.

Overloading Support: Allows different ways to initialize objects.

üß© Types of Constructors in C++
Type	Description
Default Constructor	Takes no parameters. Initializes members with default values.
Parameterized Constructor	Accepts arguments to initialize members with specific values.
Copy Constructor	Creates a new object as a copy of an existing one. Syntax: ClassName(const ClassName &obj)
Move Constructor	Transfers resources from a temporary object. Syntax: ClassName(ClassName &&obj)
