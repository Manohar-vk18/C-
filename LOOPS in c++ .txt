LOOPS in c++ >>>>
-------------
Loops : loops in c++ are used to exceute  a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.They help in managing multiple tasks

1. for loop : Used when the no of iterations is known beforehead
2. while loop : Used when the no of iterations are not known and depends on a condition
3. do while loop : similar to the while loop,but guarantees that the block of the code will be exceuted atleast once before checking the condition
